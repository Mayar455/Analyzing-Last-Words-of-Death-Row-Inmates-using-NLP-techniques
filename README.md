# Analyzing-Last-Words-of-Death-Row-Inmates-using-NLP-techniques
Introduction
• Context: The analysis of inmate last statements can provide valuable insights
into the emotions and mental states of individuals on death row. This project
aims to classify these statements based on the race of the inmates, providing a
novel application of text classification techniques.
• Primary Goal: To classify the race of inmates using their last statements with
Naive Bayes and CNN models. This helps understand how different racial
groups express themselves in their final moments.
• Methods Used: Naive Bayes for its simplicity and CNN for its ability to capture
complex patterns in text data.
